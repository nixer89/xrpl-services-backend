  title: Generic Xumm API
  description: |
   This API is dedicated to interact with Xumm and will be improved over time.
   This API is a full mirror of the [Xumm API](https://xumm.readme.io/reference/about) by [@XRPLLabs](https://twitter.com/XRPLLabs).<br>
   The prupose of this mirror API is to provide easy access to Xumm for, as example, Website developers, Alexa Skill developers, ShopPlugin developers
   and others, without the need for them to implement their own backend.
   
   The API supports all methods the Xumm API offers and also offers additional capabilities to make it easier to interact with Xumm.
   
   <b>This API only describes the additional parameters the Xumm API does not offer.</b><br>
   To check how to interact with Xumm and which fields to use, please refer to: [Xumm API](https://xumm.readme.io/reference/about)



   <b>To use this API you have to be whitlisted.</b> Please contact [@nixerFFM](https://twitter.com/nixerFFM) if you are interested to use this backend API.

                      if set to true, this parameter indicates the backend that this is a SignIn request for an upcoming payload validation by XRPL Account. (see Special-API -> signinToValidate/:signinPayload_uuid)<br>
                      The backend appends a query parameter to your defined return_url: '&signinToValidate=true'.<br>
                      You can then check for this parameter in your website after the user was returned. If set to true, you know the sent payloadId in the URL is a SignIn request payload ID which you can use to call the "signinToValidate"-API.<br>
                      This parameter allows you to have a "Pay for..." and "Sign in ..." on the same page with the same return_url.
